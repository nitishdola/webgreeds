    <description><![CDATA[<p>Founded in 2004 Trendy Sports has enjoyed huge success as one of the leading online shops for designer golf clothing.</p>

<p>Trendy Sports approached us in early 2008 and asked us to refresh the design, make the site more usable and provide them with more backend functionality.</p>

<p>In 2015 they returned for a rebuild from scratch, we built it using Spree Commerce and worked to keep their existing systems in place along with creating a gorgeous new design to tie things together.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The first time we saw String's AR showcase we couldn't believe how immersive it was.  Two years later we got to work with them.</p>

<p>Working closely with founder Al Maxwell we put together a site that pulls together animation, video and subtle UI detailing.</p>

<p>The end result is something that tries to be as immerse as their product offering and has led to an increase volume of enquiries from new recruits and potential companies alike.</p>]]></description>
